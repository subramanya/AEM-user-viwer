You need to download the AEM 5.6.1 quickstart.jar file
Unzip aem-5.6.1-quickstart.jar file extract it.  
Inside crx-quickstart folder there is "opt" folder. This contains "filefault" folder. This "filefault" contains two folders:
"bin" and "lib."
"bin" folder has "vlt" executalbe. we can copy this any where in file system and 
We need to add "vlt" filepath to  environent varialbe path ((in bash_profile file so that "vlt" can be executed 
 from any directory). 
We need to copy the "lib" foler to user's home directory, for example copy "lib" folder to:/Users/slaks1/)
